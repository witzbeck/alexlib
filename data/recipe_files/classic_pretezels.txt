Boiling: Boil the pretzels in batches in a large pot of water with baking soda for 30 seconds each, then remove with a slotted spoon.
Baking: Place boiled pretzels on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake at 425°F for 12-14 minutes until golden brown.
