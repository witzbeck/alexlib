Equipment
    • Large bowl
    • 9x5 inch loaf pan
    • Oven
    • Damp cloth
    • Wire rack
    • Brush (optional, for egg wash)

Ingredients
    • 3 cups all-purpose flour (extra for dusting)
    • 1 packet (2¼ tsp) active dry yeast
    • 1 cup warm water (around 110°F or 45°C)
    • 2 tablespoons sugar
    • 1 tablespoon salt
    • 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
    • Optional: 1 egg (for egg wash)

Instructions
    • Activate the Yeast:
        Dissolve sugar in warm water, 
        sprinkle yeast over the top, 
        and let sit for about 10 minutes until frothy.
    • Make the Dough: 
        [Without Mixer]
            Add salt, butter, and flour to yeast mixture, 
            mix to form a shaggy dough. 
            Knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
        [With Mixer]
            Attach the dough hook to your stand mixer.
            In the mixer’s bowl, add the activated yeast mixture, salt, softened butter, and half the flour. 
            Start the mixer at a low speed (setting 2 or the stir setting on your model) to combine the ingredients.
            Gradually add the remaining flour until the dough starts to form. 
            You might not need all the flour, or you might need a little extra, depending on the dough's consistency. 
            The dough should be slightly sticky but should form a ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

    • First Rise: 
        Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
    • Shape the Bread: 
        Punch down dough, shape into a loaf, and place in a greased loaf pan.
    • Second Rise: 
        Cover the loaf and let it rise for about 30 minutes, or until it puffs up just above the rim of the pan.
    • Preheat Oven: 
        Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    • Optional Egg Wash: 
        If using, beat an egg with a tablespoon of water and brush it over the top of the loaf.
    • Bake: 
        Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
    • Cool: 
        Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan. 
        After a few minutes, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
    • Slice and Serve: 
        Slice the bread and serve it warm, or store it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Notes
    • Yeast: 
        If using instant yeast, skip the activation step.
    • Flour: 
        Bread flour can be used for a chewier loaf.
    • Butter: 
        Olive oil can be used for a dairy-free loaf.
    • Egg Wash: 
        This is optional but gives the bread a beautiful golden crust.
    • Storage: 
        Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
    • Serving Suggestions: 
        Enjoy on its own, with butter, honey, or cinnamon sugar.
Additional Tips for Using a KitchenAid Mixer
    • Dough Hook: 
        Always use the dough hook attachment for kneading bread dough. It's designed to mimic hand-kneading, giving you a perfect dough with less effort.
    • Speed Settings: 
        Be careful not to overmix. 
        Using a too high speed can overheat and potentially harm the dough's structure.
    • Observation: 
        Keep an eye on the dough during the initial mixing and kneading in the mixer. 
        You may need to stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally.
