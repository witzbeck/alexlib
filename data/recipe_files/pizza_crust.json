    "steps": [
        "Prepare the Yeast Mixture: Mix sugar and warm water in a bowl. Sprinkle yeast over the top, and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.",
        "Make the Dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the frothy yeast mixture with flour, salt, and olive oil. Stir until the mixture forms a sticky dough. On a floured surface, knead the dough for about 7-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough for about 5 minutes on a medium-low setting.",
        "First Rise: Place the kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat all sides with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.",
        "Form the Pizzas: Punch down the risen dough to release air. Divide it into 2 equal pieces for two pizzas. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece into a 12-inch round, or press it out with your fingers for a more rustic look.",
        "Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven now. If not, prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Bake: Transfer your pizza base onto the pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes, then remove it to add your favorite toppings. Return it to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.",
        "Cool and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot."

    "notes": "Instant yeast speeds up the process as it doesn’t need to be activated, but active dry yeast can also be used after activating it as mentioned. For a crispier crust, substitute half of the all-purpose flour with bread flour. Olive oil adds flavor and helps to create a tender crust. Ensure the water is warm to touch but not hot, to activate the yeast without killing it. Rising time can vary depending on the room temperature. Pre-cook ingredients that release water or require longer cooking times to prevent a soggy crust. Dough can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before use."
