Creating a comprehensive set of test cases for the given Python file involves validating the functionality of each class and method, ensuring they perform as expected under various scenarios. Since your code involves creating a PDF file from a recipe text, the tests should cover different aspects of PDF generation, text parsing, and font handling. Here's a suggested set of test cases:

### 1. Font Class Tests
- **Test Default Font Initialization**: Verify that a `Font` object initializes with the default values (`name="times"`, `size=12`).
- **Test Custom Font Initialization**: Initialize a `Font` object with custom values and verify they are set correctly.
- **Test PostScript Name Generation**: Test the `ps_name`, `bold`, `italic`, and `bold_italic` properties for various font names and ensure the correct PostScript names are returned.
- **Test Tuple Conversion**: Verify that the `astuple` method correctly returns a tuple representation of the font.

### 2. RecipeOutput Class Tests
- **Test Default RecipeOutput Initialization**: Verify that a `RecipeOutput` object initializes correctly with default values.
- **Test Custom RecipeOutput Initialization**: Initialize a `RecipeOutput` object with custom values and verify they are set correctly.
- **Test Line Splitting**: Verify that the `lines` property correctly splits the recipe text into lines.
- **Test Filename Generation**: Check that the `filename` property generates the correct filename based on the provided `name`.
- **Test Page Height Calculation**: Verify that the `page_height` property returns the correct height based on `pagesize`.
- **Test Line Drawing Logic**: Verify that `draw_line` correctly calculates the new height after drawing a line, including special cases for titles, list items, and numbered items.
- **Test PDF Drawing**: Although challenging to test without generating a file, ensure that the `draw` method correctly handles multiple lines, page breaks, and applies the correct styles.

### 3. export_recipe_to_pdf Function Tests
- **Test PDF Export**: Verify that the `export_recipe_to_pdf` function creates a PDF file with the expected filename.
- **Test PDF Content**: This is more complex but important. You might need to open the generated PDF and verify that the content matches the input recipe text.

### 4. Edge Cases and Error Handling
- **Test Invalid Font Inputs**: Check how the `Font` class handles invalid font names or sizes.
- **Test Empty Recipe Text**: Ensure that the code handles empty recipe texts without errors.
- **Test Invalid Recipe Format**: Input a recipe with incorrect formatting and verify that the program handles it gracefully.
- **Test Large Recipe Text**: Test with a very long recipe to ensure that page handling and text splitting work correctly.

### 5. Performance Tests
- **Test Large File Performance**: Test the performance with a very large recipe to see how the system handles more substantial loads.

### 6. Integration Test
- **End-to-End Test**: Run the complete process with a standard recipe text to ensure that all components work together correctly, resulting in a correctly formatted PDF.

Remember to use assertions in your tests to automatically verify that the output of each function or method is as expected. Additionally, consider using a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` for better organization and reporting of your tests.
