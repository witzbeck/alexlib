SERVINGS    | 2 pizzas
PREP TIME   | 15 minutes
COOK TIME   | 20 minutes
TOTAL TIME  | 2 hours 5 minutes

Equipment
    • Large mixing bowl
    • Pizza stone or baking sheet
    • Oven
    • Rolling pin (optional)
    • Damp cloth
    • Kitchen scale (optional for precise measurements)

Ingredients
    • 4 cups all-purpose flour (extra for dusting)
    • 1 packet (2¼ tsp) instant dry yeast
    • 1½ cups warm water (around 110°F or 45°C)
    • 1 teaspoon sugar
    • 2 teaspoons salt
    • 2 tablespoons olive oil (extra for bowl)

Instructions
    • Prepare the Yeast Mixture:
        Mix sugar and warm water in a bowl. 
        Sprinkle yeast over the top, 
        and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
    • Make the Dough: 
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the frothy yeast mixture with flour, salt, and olive oil. 
        Stir until the mixture forms a sticky dough.
        On a floured surface, knead the dough for about 7-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.
        Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough for about 5 minutes on a medium-low setting.
    
    • First Rise: 
        Place the kneaded dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat all sides with oil. 
        Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
    
    • Form the Pizzas: 
        Punch down the risen dough to release air. 
        Divide it into 2 equal pieces for two pizzas. 
        On a lightly floured surface, roll out each piece into a 12-inch round, or press it out with your fingers for a more rustic look.
    
    • Preheat Oven: 
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven now. If not, prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    
    • Bake: 
        Transfer your pizza base onto the pizza stone or baking sheet. 
        Bake for 5 minutes, then remove it to add your favorite toppings.
        Return it to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.
    
    • Cool and Serve: 
        Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot.

Notes
    • Yeast: 
        Instant yeast speeds up the process as it doesn’t need to be activated, but active dry yeast can also be used after activating it as mentioned.
    • Flour: 
        For a crispier crust, substitute half of the all-purpose flour with bread flour.
    • Olive Oil: 
        Adds flavor and helps to create a tender crust. Can be substituted with another vegetable oil if preferred.
    • Water Temperature: 
        Ensure the water is warm to touch but not hot, to activate the yeast without killing it.
    • Rising Time: 
        Can vary depending on the room temperature. Warmer environments speed up the rise.
    • Toppings: 
        Pre-cook ingredients that release water or require longer cooking times to prevent a soggy crust.
    • Storage: 
        Dough can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before use.
