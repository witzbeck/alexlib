Integrating `pytest-mock` and `coverage` into your codebase for testing involves several steps, including installation, configuration, writing test cases using mocks, and executing tests with coverage analysis. Here’s a guide to help you integrate these tools into your Python project:

### Step 1: Install Pytest, Pytest-Mock, and Coverage
First, you need to install `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, and `coverage`. You can do this using `pip`. It's a good practice to manage your Python dependencies in a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-mock coverage
```

### Step 2: Configure Pytest and Coverage
You can configure `pytest` and `coverage` by creating configuration files in your project root: `pytest.ini` for pytest and `.coveragerc` for coverage.

#### pytest.ini
This file can be used to configure various pytest settings. A basic setup might look like this:

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
addopts = -ra -q
testpaths =
    tests
```

#### .coveragerc
This file is used to configure coverage settings. A basic setup might include:

```ini
# .coveragerc
[run]
branch = True
source = your_package_name

[report]
show_missing = True
exclude_lines =
    if __name__ == .__main__.:
```

Replace `your_package_name` with the name of your package.

### Step 3: Writing Test Cases with Pytest-Mock
`pytest-mock` simplifies the use of mocks in pytest. Here’s an example of how you might write a test case with a mock:

```python
# Example test case using pytest-mock
def test_database_connection(mocker):
    # Mock a database connection method
    mock_connection = mocker.patch('alexlib.db.managers.create_engine')

    # Call your function that should make a database connection
    DatabaseManager.from_auth(auth_credentials)

    # Assert that the create_engine was called once
    mock_connection.assert_called_once()
```

In this example, `mocker.patch` replaces the real `create_engine` method with a mock, allowing you to assert that it was called as expected without making a real database connection.

### Step 4: Running Tests with Coverage
To run your tests with coverage, use the `coverage` command. This will execute your tests and collect coverage data:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

After running your tests, you can generate a coverage report:

```bash
coverage report
```

Or, for an HTML report:

```bash
coverage html
```

This will generate a report in the `htmlcov` directory, which you can open in a web browser to see a detailed coverage report.

### Step 5: Continuous Integration
If you are using Continuous Integration (CI), you can integrate these steps into your CI pipeline. This ensures that tests are run and coverage is reported for every change in your codebase.

### Additional Tips
- **Test Isolation**: Ensure each test is independent and can run in any order. `pytest-mock` helps with this by resetting mocks between tests.
- **Code Coverage Goals**: Aim for a high percentage of code coverage, but remember that 100% coverage doesn’t guarantee bug-free code.
- **Mock Responsibly**: Use mocks to simulate external systems or to isolate parts of your system under test. However, be cautious not to overuse mocks, as they can hide real integration issues.

Integrating these tools into your workflow can significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of your codebase, especially for a complex module like `alexlib.db.managers`.

Using advanced features of `pytest` can greatly enhance your testing experience and the quality of your tests. Coupled with `coverage`, you can ensure that your test suite comprehensively covers your codebase. Here’s a guide to some advanced features of `pytest` and how to integrate them with `coverage`.

### 1. Fixtures for Setup and Teardown
`pytest` fixtures allow you to set up and tear down resources needed by tests. Fixtures are reusable and can be scoped to function, class, module, or session.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def database_connection():
    # Setup: establish database connection
    db = create_database_connection()
    yield db
    # Teardown: close database connection
    db.close()

def test_query(database_connection):
    # Use the database_connection fixture
    assert database_connection.run_query("SELECT * FROM table")
```

### 2. Parameterized Tests
You can use parameterization to run a test function with different arguments.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "input,expected",
    [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), ("6*9", 54)],
)
def test_eval(input, expected):
    assert eval(input) == expected
```

### 3. Using Mocks with pytest-mock
`pytest-mock` integrates the `unittest.mock` package with pytest, making it easier to use mocks.

```python
def test_function(mocker):
    mock = mocker.patch('module.ClassName')
    mock.return_value.method.return_value = "Mocked Value"
    assert function_that_uses_class() == "Mocked Value"
```

### 4. Custom Markers for Test Categorization
You can define your own markers in `pytest.ini` to categorize tests, such as for slow tests or integration tests.

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
markers =
    slow: mark a test as slow to run
```

Then, you can use this marker in your tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_slow_function():
    pass
```

Run only slow tests with `pytest -m slow` or exclude them with `pytest -m "not slow"`.

### 5. Coverage Integration
To ensure `coverage` works well with `pytest`, use the `coverage run` command with the `-m` flag to run the `pytest` module.

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
```

After the tests have completed, generate a coverage report:

```bash
coverage report
```

Or, for a more detailed HTML report:

```bash
coverage html
```

### 6. Configuring Coverage with .coveragerc
Customize how `coverage` works by creating a `.coveragerc` file. For example:

```ini
# .coveragerc
[run]
omit =
    */tests/*
    */config.py

[report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    if self.debug:
    raise AssertionError
    raise NotImplementedError
```

### 7. Continuous Integration
In a CI pipeline, you can integrate these steps to automatically run tests and coverage on every push. Example for a CI configuration file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/python-app.yml
name: Python application

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install pytest pytest-mock coverage
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        coverage run -m pytest
    - name: Coverage report
      run: |
        coverage report
        coverage html
    - name: Archive coverage results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: coverage-report
        path: htmlcov/
```

### 8. Advanced pytest Features
- **Using `pytest.raises`**: Test that a specific exception is raised.
- **Temporary directories and files**: Use `tmp_path` or `tmpdir` fixtures for tests that need to work with filesystem.
- **Skipping Tests**: Use `pytest.skip()` to skip a test for certain conditions.
- **Using `pytest-xdist` for parallel testing**: Speed up your test suite by running tests in parallel.

Integrating `pytest` with these advanced features and `coverage` can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your testing process, providing a robust framework for ensuring the quality of your code.
