Creating a comprehensive set of test cases for the provided file involves testing each class and method systematically. Given the two classes `RandGen` and `FileFaker`, along with the helper function `pick_yn`, here's how the test cases could be structured:

#### 1.8 `mk_test_name`
- Test with various ranges for `min_` and `max_`.
- Test with combinations of `let_` and `intstr_`.

#### 1.9 `mk_test_ext`
- Test with different ranges for `_min` and `_max`.

#### 1.10 `mk_text`
- Test with various lengths for `lim`.

#### 1.11 `mk_dirname` and `mk_filename`
- Test these methods to ensure they generate strings in expected formats.

#### 1.12 `mk_timedelta`
- Test with different ranges for `min_days` and `max_days`.

#### 1.13 `mk_datetime`
- Test with different ranges for `min_year` and `max_year`.

### 2. FileFaker Class Test Cases
#### 2.1 `mk_filepath`
- Test to ensure it returns a valid file path within the given directory.

#### 2.2 `write_file`
- Test writing a file with and without text.
- Test with `overwrite=True` and `overwrite=False`.

#### 2.3 `write_files`
- Test with different numbers of files.
- Test additional parameters passed to `write_file`.

#### 2.4 `mk_dirpath`
- Test to ensure it generates a valid directory path within the given target directory.

#### 2.5 `write_dir`
- Test creating a directory in the target directory.

#### 2.6 `setup_dirs` and `setup_files`
- Test creating multiple directories and files.
- Verify the structure and contents of created directories and files.

#### 2.7 `__post_init__`
- Test to verify directories and files are created upon initialization.

#### 2.8 `teardown`
- Test to ensure all created directories and files are properly removed.

### 3. Helper Function `pick_yn`
- Test with no bias (equal probability for 'Y' and 'N').
- Test with various biases towards 'Y' or 'N'.
- Test edge cases like 0% or 100% bias.

### Additional Considerations
- Error Handling: Test how each method behaves when invalid inputs are provided.
- Edge Cases: Consider boundary values and special cases for each method.
- Resource Cleanup: Ensure that all file operations clean up any created files or directories to avoid side effects.
- Randomness: Since randomness is involved, consider running tests multiple times to ensure consistency in behavior.
- Performance: Test the performance for methods that handle large amounts of data or complex operations.
- Integration Tests: Besides unit tests, consider writing tests that integrate multiple components (e.g., using `RandGen` methods in `FileFaker` operations).

This comprehensive approach ensures thorough testing of all functionalities and potential edge cases in the module.
