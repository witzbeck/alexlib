Creating a comprehensive set of test cases for this file involves ensuring that each function and class behaves as expected under various conditions. Here's a breakdown for each function and class:

14. **get_attrs**
    - Test with an object having various attributes, including hidden and dunder attributes.
    - Test with `include_hidden` and `include_dunder` flags both on and off.

15. **show_dict**
    - Test with various dictionaries and lists of dictionaries.

16. **to_clipboard**
    - Test with various strings.
    - Test error handling for command not found or execution error.

17. **copy_file_to_clipboard**
    - Test with existing and non-existing files.
    - Test with non-file paths (e.g., directories).

18. **get_objects_by_attr**
    - Test with a list of objects having a specific attribute.
    - Test with various values and non-existing attributes.

19. **mk_dictvals_distinct**
    - Test with dictionaries having lists as values, including duplicate elements.

20. **invert_dict**
    - Test with standard dictionaries.
    - Test with dictionaries that cannot be inverted (e.g., non-unique values).

21. **sha256sum**
    - Test with existing and non-existing files.
    - Test with different file contents to ensure correct hash.

22. **chkhash**
    - Test with files and their correct and incorrect hashes.

23. **get_last_tag**
    - Test in a git repository context to ensure correct tag retrieval.

24. **get_curent_version**
    - Test with various tag formats to ensure correct version extraction.

25. **Version Class**
    - Test `from_tag` method to ensure correct version extraction from git tags.
    - Test string representation and iteration methods.

26. **ping**
    - Test with various host and port combinations.
    - Test with `astext` flag both on and off.

Additionally, it's important to include tests for error handling and edge cases, ensuring the module behaves predictably under unexpected conditions. Use Python's `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks for efficient and structured testing.
