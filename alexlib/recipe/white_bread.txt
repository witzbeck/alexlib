Equipment
    • Large bowl
    • 9x5 inch loaf pan
    • Oven
    • Damp cloth
    • Wire rack
    • Brush (optional, for egg wash)

Ingredients
    • 3 cups all-purpose flour (extra for dusting)
    • 1 packet (2¼ tsp) active dry yeast
    • 1 cup warm water (around 110°F or 45°C)
    • 2 tablespoons sugar
    • 1 tablespoon salt
    • 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
    • Optional: 1 egg (for egg wash)

Instructions
    • Activate the Yeast: Dissolve sugar in warm water, sprinkle yeast over the top, and let sit for about 10 minutes until frothy.
    • Make the Dough: Add salt, butter, and flour to yeast mixture, mix to form a shaggy dough. Knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
    • First Rise: Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
    • Shape the Bread: Punch down dough, shape into a loaf, and place in a greased loaf pan.
    • Second Rise: Cover the loaf and let it rise for about 30 minutes, or until it puffs up just above the rim of the pan.
    • Preheat Oven: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    • Optional Egg Wash: If using, beat an egg with a tablespoon of water and brush it over the top of the loaf.
    • Bake: Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
    • Cool: Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
    • Slice and Serve: Slice the bread and serve it warm, or store it in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Notes
    • Yeast: If using instant yeast, skip the activation step.
    • Flour: Bread flour can be used for a chewier loaf.
    • Butter: Olive oil can be used for a dairy-free loaf.
    • Egg Wash: This is optional but gives the bread a beautiful golden crust.
    • Storage: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
    • Serving Suggestions: Enjoy on its own, with butter, honey, or cinnamon sugar.
