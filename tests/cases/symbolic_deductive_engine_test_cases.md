To create a comprehensive set of test cases for `symbolic_deductive_engine.py`, it's essential to understand the functionalities of the `Response` class, `symbolic_deductive_engine_path`, and the `show_dict` function. Here's a structured approach for testing:

### 1. Testing the `Response` Class
- **Test Case 1: Initialization of Response Object**
  - Objective: Verify if a `Response` object can be correctly instantiated using `symbolic_deductive_engine_path`.
  - Data: Provide `symbolic_deductive_engine_path` as an argument.
  - Expected Result: The `Response` object is created without errors.

- **Test Case 2: Response Object Attributes**
  - Objective: Check if the `Response` object has specific attributes (like `heading_step_index_map`, `heading_step_map`, etc.).
  - Data: Create a `Response` object.
  - Expected Result: The object contains all expected attributes.

- **Test Case 3: Invalid Path Handling**
  - Objective: Verify how the `Response` class handles an invalid path.
  - Data: Provide an invalid path to the `Response` constructor.
  - Expected Result: The class should handle this gracefully, possibly raising an error or exception.

### 2. Testing `show_dict` Function
- **Test Case 4: Displaying Non-Empty Dictionary**
  - Objective: Ensure `show_dict` correctly displays the contents of a non-empty dictionary.
  - Data: Pass a non-empty dictionary to `show_dict`.
  - Expected Result: Correct display output of dictionary contents.

- **Test Case 5: Displaying Empty Dictionary**
  - Objective: Test `show_dict` with an empty dictionary.
  - Data: Pass an empty dictionary.
  - Expected Result: Appropriate handling of an empty dictionary, possibly by displaying a specific message or no output.

- **Test Case 6: Handling Non-Dictionary Input**
  - Objective: Verify how `show_dict` behaves with input that is not a dictionary.
  - Data: Provide different data types (e.g., list, string, integer).
  - Expected Result: The function should handle non-dictionary inputs appropriately, possibly by raising an error or ignoring them.

### 3. Integration Tests
- **Test Case 7: Integration of `Response` with `show_dict`**
  - Objective: Test the integration of `Response` class attributes with `show_dict`.
  - Data: Create a `Response` object and use its attributes with `show_dict`.
  - Expected Result: The `show_dict` function should display the contents of the `Response` object's attributes correctly.

### 4. Output Verification
- **Test Case 8: Verifying Output Format**
  - Objective: Ensure the output format of `show_dict` is consistent and readable.
  - Data: Pass dictionaries with various contents.
  - Expected Result: The output format should be consistent and easy to read.

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Test Case 9: Exception Handling in `Response`**
  - Objective: Test how the `Response` class handles exceptions during initialization.
  - Data: Provide scenarios that may cause exceptions (e.g., file not found, read permission issues).
  - Expected Result: The `Response` class should handle exceptions gracefully.

### Notes for Implementation:
- Each test case should be implemented as an individual test function.
- Use assert statements to validate expected outcomes.
- Consider setting up mock data or a mock environment, especially for file-based operations.
- Utilize a unit testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` for organizing tests and output formatting.
- Capture and verify console outputs, especially for `show_dict` function tests, to ensure correct display formatting.
