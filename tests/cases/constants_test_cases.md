To create a comprehensive set of test cases for the provided Python file, we need to cover each defined constant and functionality. Here's a breakdown of the test cases:

1. **ENVIRONMENTS**
   - Test to ensure `ENVIRONMENTS` contains exactly three elements: "dev", "test", "prod".

2. **SQL_CHARS**
   - Test to confirm `SQL_CHARS` correctly combines `ascii_letters` and `digits` with space and underscore.

3. **COL_SUBS**
   - Verify that all specified characters (" ", "-", "#", "&", "/", "%", ".", ",", "<", ">", "=") are correctly mapped to their replacements.
   - Test with a string containing all these characters and ensure the substitution is as expected.

4. **SQL_SUBS**
   - Test to ensure that `SQL_SUBS` correctly filters `COL_SUBS` based on the condition provided.
   - Test with a string containing characters both in and not in `SQL_KEYS` to ensure correct filtering.

5. **SQL_INFOSCHEMA_COL**
   - Test that the `SQL_INFOSCHEMA_COL` string is exactly as defined.

6. **SQL_KEYS**
   - Test to confirm that `SQL_KEYS` correctly lists the keys from `SQL_SUBS`.

7. **Date and Time Formats**
   - For `DATE_FORMAT`, `TIME_FORMAT`, and `DATETIME_FORMAT`, test with various valid and invalid dates and times to ensure the formats are correctly applied.
   - Test edge cases like leap years, seconds at 59, etc.

8. **EPOCH and EPOCH_SECONDS**
   - Verify that `EPOCH` is set to the correct date.
   - Test `EPOCH_SECONDS` to ensure it correctly represents the timestamp of `EPOCH`.

9. **HOME, CREDS, VENVS**
   - Test to ensure `HOME` is correctly set to the user's home directory.
   - Test `CREDS` and `VENVS` for:
     - Correct path concatenation with `HOME`.
     - Correct functioning of `mkdir` with `exist_ok=True`.
     - Test behavior when directories already exist and when they don't.

10. **General Integration Tests**
    - Write a script using all constants and functionalities together to ensure they work in unison as expected.
    - This includes testing string substitutions in a SQL context, path operations, and date/time formatting.

11. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
    - Test how the code behaves with unexpected inputs (e.g., non-string inputs where strings are expected).
    - Test boundary conditions, like empty strings, extremely long strings, or unusual characters.

These tests will ensure that each part of the code functions as expected individually and when integrated. Additionally, consider using Python's `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks for efficient and structured testing.
